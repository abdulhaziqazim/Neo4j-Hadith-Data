## 📌 Project Overview

Hadith texts contain rich, multi-layered information such as **narrators, themes, sources, and contextual relationships**. However, traditional keyword-based search systems struggle to capture these complex relationships.

This project proposes an **automated information tagging model** that transforms **structured Hadith data into a Knowledge Graph**, enabling **semantic understanding, relational querying, and advanced retrieval** of Hadith knowledge.

By combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with **graph databases**, this system provides a modern and scalable approach to digital Hadith studies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an **information tagging model** for Hadith texts  
- Automatically identify:
  - Narrators
  - Themes
  - Sources
  - Relationships between Hadith entities
- Construct a **Knowledge Graph** representation of Hadith data
- Evaluate the tagging model using standard NLP metrics

---

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Regular Expressions
- **Data Tagging Model**
  - Narrator extraction
  - Theme classification
- **Knowledge Graph**
  - Neo4j Graph Database

## 🗂 Dataset

- **Source**: https://sunnah.com  
- **Total Hadiths**: 45,346 English-translated Hadiths  
- **Collections Include**:
  - Sahih Muslim
  - Sahih Bukhari
  - Sunan Abi Dawud
  - and others

Data was collected using **web scraping**, then cleaned, normalized, and merged before tagging.

## 📊 Model Performance

The tagging model was evaluated against **human-extracted ground truth**:

| Metric     | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Precision | 0.646 |
| Recall    | 0.663 |
| F1-Score  | 0.649 |

These results indicate that the model performs **effectively and consistently** for automated Hadith knowledge extraction.
